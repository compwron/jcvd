To use:
Ruby 1.9.2. App assumes use of rvm. 
1. You must be on the Chi TW VPN

3. export your AD password as an environment variable (example: export TWPASS=yourpass)
4. Make test file testfile.json containing a line like {"name":"Your Name","email":"your_email@domain.com","mobile":"1111111111"} 
5. bundle install
6. bundle exec ./jcvd --email --sms --call testdata.json # this tests the contact capability 
7. bundle exec ./tec # this tests the data retrieval capability. You might not have access to Peoplesoft. 

Do NOT pipe the output of tec to jcvd unless you are intentionally contacting several hundred people

Example usages: 

tec --region desired_region | jcvd --call

tec > file ; jcvd --email file

tec --region au | jcvd --email

tec --region us | jcvd --email --sms --phone

You will need a Twilio account to make phone calls.
